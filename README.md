As the first person to enter The Athenaeum, an infamously haunted library, in decades, youâ€™ll find yourself far deeper in the stacks that you originally expected. Legends claim that the library was once a beacon of knowledge filled with enthusiastic scholars and cheerful bookworms. Now all that is left are ghosts and cobwebs. Revive this mythical library by breaking the long-standing curse and bringing back its patrons. Fight through a variety of stories and befriend library visitors to restore The Athenaeum to its former glory.

In this game, Spell-Bound, a Unity-based combination of a roguelite and social simulator aimed at gamers aged 13 and up, players will be able to engage in unique, dynamic dialogue facilitated by a Large Language Model and experience new worlds as they free books from the curse. The game should appeal to people who enjoy video games, fantasy, and libraries.
